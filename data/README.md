[![ReadMe](https://img.shields.io/badge/ReadMe-018EF5?logo=readme&logoColor=fff)](#)

## Description
This folder contains the input files required for the workflow to function. The files include the candidate's CV and the job description, which are used by the agents to evaluate the candidate's suitability for the job and generate a draft email.

## Files
- **`cv.txt`**: A personal CV used for this tutorial. You can replace this file with any CV of your choice.
- **`job_description.txt`**: An invented job description for a fictional company called MAIgents. Feel free to replace this file with any job description that fits your needs.

## Usage
Ensure that the `cv.txt` and `job_description.txt` files are present in this folder before running the workflow. The agents will read these files during the initial steps of the process.

## Notes
- The files should be in plain text format (`.txt`).
- Both files are placeholders for demonstration purposes and can be replaced with any other CV or job description.
- Ensure the content is formatted clearly to improve the accuracy of the evaluation.
